# book-recommendation

This code is designed to build a collaborative filtering model using TensorFlow and Keras for recommending books based on user ratings. The model uses two types of embeddings, one for users and one for books, which are then concatenated and passed through several dense layers for prediction. It is trained on the training data with mean squared error loss function and Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer, and its performance is evaluated on the testing data.
